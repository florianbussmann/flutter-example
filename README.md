# flutter_example

[![Build](https://github.com/florianbussmann/flutter-example/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/florianbussmann/flutter-example/actions/workflows/build.yml)

In this repository you will find a [CI/CD configuration](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/) for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to
- build [Android Packages](https://github.com/florianbussmann/flutter-example/actions/workflows/build.yml) (APK)
- build [web app](https://florianbussmann.github.io/flutter-example/) and deploy using GitHub Pages

The pipeline uses the sample application that was generated by calling `flutter create flutter_example`.
